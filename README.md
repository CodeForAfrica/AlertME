\#GreenAlert
============

*Get to know more about your environment.*

\#GreenAlert is a geo-aware web platform that is working to make it easier for everyone to get invloved in decisions made about the environment around them. This is achieved by giving easy access to the data and allowing subscription of alerts.

Some key featutres of this platform include:

1. Geocodes and caches addresses for easy mapping.
2. Allows defining data in the dashboard from **any** CSV.
3. Automated category assignment via keyword search.
4. Subscription of alerts in a specified area or individual project.

**NOTE: This project is still in very initial development.**
*(We intend to break things along the way but will do our best to keep it consistent)*
